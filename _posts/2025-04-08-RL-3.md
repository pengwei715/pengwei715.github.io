Note three of RL course from Alberta University.


### Parameterized funcitions to approximate values

Bring some parameters into the value function with the state,

$$V(s, w)$$ Where w is the parameter vector. We can learn the w.

The weights can be changes so the value function can be changed.



### Linear value function approximation

$$v(s, w) = \sum W_i x_i(s)$$

Where $x_i$ is the feature vector. The features are the basis functions.


### Generalization and Discrimination

Generalization: updates to one state affect the value of other states.

Discrimination: the ability to make the value of two states different.
