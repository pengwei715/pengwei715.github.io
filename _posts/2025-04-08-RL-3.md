Note three of RL course from Alberta University.


### Parameterized funcitions to approximate values

Bring some parameters into the value function with the state,

$$V(s, w)$$ Where w is the parameter vector. We can learn the w.

The weights can be changes so the value function can be changed.



### Linear value function approximation
