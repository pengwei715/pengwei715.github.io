# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Data

Need a lot of right data.

## Model

Statistical model
Deeplearning model


## Objective functions

In order to develop a formal mathematical system of learning machines, we need to have formal measures of how good our
models are. These measures are called objective functions.

Some objectives are easy to optimize, while others are diffcult to optimize directly. We can optimize a surrogate
objective instead.

## Optimization

algorithm capable of searching for the best possible parameters for minimizing the loss function.

## Supervised learning

1. Regression

2. classification

3. Tagging

4. Search

5. Recommender systems

6. Sequence learning
