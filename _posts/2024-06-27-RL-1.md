Note one of RL course from Alberta University


### Roadmap

1. Mutlti-armed bandit problem (MAB)
2. Markov Decision Process (MDP)
3. Dynamic programming


### K-armed bandit problem

Agent needs to choose from k actions, each action will have a unknown reward.
Once the action is performed, the agent see the reward.
- reward
- time steps
- values
The values of the action is the expected reward of taking that action.
The goal of the agent is to maximize the expected reward.
argmax_a Q(a) = a*. which means the argument which maximizes the q* function.


### Action-value methods

- Sample-average method

- Greedy action selection

- exploration-exploitation dilemma
